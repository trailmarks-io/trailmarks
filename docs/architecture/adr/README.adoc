= Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Trailmarks project.

== What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

== ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

* *Status*: PROPOSED, ACCEPTED, DEPRECATED, or SUPERSEDED
* *Context*: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
* *Decision*: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
* *Consequences*: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
