# OAuth 2 Authentication Service Selection - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for selecting an OAuth 2 authentication and authorization service for the Trailmarks application.

## Quick Summary

**Recommendation:** Keycloak

**Full ADR:** See [ADR-0001: OAuth 2 Authentication and Authorization Service](0001-oauth2-authentication-service.adoc)

## Services Evaluated

1. **Keycloak** ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)
   - Enterprise-grade, mature solution
   - Excellent Docker support
   - Comprehensive .NET integration
   - Full OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - Resource requirement: 512MB-1GB RAM

2. **Authentik**
   - Modern, lightweight alternative
   - Good for smaller deployments
   - Lower resource usage: 256MB-512MB RAM

3. **Ory (Kratos + Hydra)**
   - Cloud-native, efficient
   - Requires multiple services
   - No built-in admin UI

4. **Auth0 by Okta**
   - Excellent but cloud-only
   - Does not meet Docker/self-hosted requirement

5. **Zitadel**
   - Modern, promising
   - Smaller community

## Why Keycloak?

### Key Strengths
- ✅ Industry standard, battle-tested
- ✅ Backed by Red Hat (IBM)
- ✅ Comprehensive feature set out-of-the-box
